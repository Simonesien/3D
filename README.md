# 3D Programming Fundamentals in Javascript
This repository contains the files of my 3D Programming Project. It started 4.12.2021, but for 1,5 years I couldn't finish it. Now I decided to upload it hoping that  
a) someone learns something from my code and/or  
b) some pro can help me finish my code.  

# My Problem
I do not understand how to change the near plane for clipping when the FOV changes. Even with the default FOV, the elements seem to be cut off before reaching the camera.  
If you think you can help or see what I got wrong, feel free to open an issue. At any time. Really!

# Credits
Most of my current understanding of 3D comes from ChiliTomatoNoodle's series [3D Programming Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehGqieEbus&list=PLqCJpWy5Fohe8ucwhksiv9hTF5sfid8lA).

# License
Everyone can use the code in this project to learn and even to build something (although I do not recommend doing so, better use OpenGL or WebGL), but not without credit.
